							<b style="color: #000;">Excellence In Co-curricular Activities</b>
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">MIS grooms, nurtures and develops its students beyond academics. MIS gets the best out of children in every department. The school teachers and mentors work closely with parents to identify and nurture the latent potential of children which ultimately boosts their overall character development. At MIS children can take up computer lab, physical activities, team sports, singing & dancing, art and craft and lots more. We have associate mentors for each department and we believe that this “other side of a student’s life” must be given a proper sense of empowerment.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">We have consciously and consistently endeavoured to evolve a
system which inculcates sensitive and ethical sensibility among our
learners. Our ethos are embodied in drama, songs, competitions,
assemblies, protests, symposia, book discussions and seminars. All this
encourage moral and ethical learning through reflection of what is right and
wrong in our world.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">From class assemblies and Inter house competitions to participating
in inter school events, Magadhians education has empowered us in different
ways. The canvas of our learning gets filled with joy as we voice our
thoughts and opinions in elocutions, express our creativity through art,
theatre, music, dance and movie making, Leadership Conventions,
Seminars and Exhibitions.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">As always, Students keenly participated and performed
commendably in the English, Cyber, Mathematics and Science Olympiads.
Some of them also secured high ranks at the state and national level.</p>

						<h6>Four major domains of Talent Development laid out by the MIS are:</h6>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;"><b>Intellectual Abilities:</b> Encompassing the areas of language,
mathematics and science, intellectual ability development including
reading, writing and oral communication, traditional and applied
mathematics and other inspiring learning projects.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;"><b>Creative Abilities:</b> Covering confidence building and mindexpanding project areas such as Indian and world vocal and
instrumental music, dance, drama, photography, painting and
sculpture.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;"><b>Physical and MentalAbilities:</b> Offering a variety of physical and
mental activities for a healthy young mind and body including yoga,
athletics, team sports, adventure sports and chess.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;"><b>Social Abilities:</b> To enable each child to improve his interactions
with classmates, teachers and parents, there are various projects
which deal with concepts such as development of leadership
qualities, problem solving abilities and interpersonal
communication.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">We also encourage students from an early age to take responsibility
for their community. Students contribute to decision-making in the school
through student councils. Activities involving the wider community
generally focus on developing a sense of responsibility for the common
good.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">The school runs a house system. Every student belongs to one of four
houses. Within their houses students take positions of responsibility,
compete against other houses in sport and music and work towards common
goals in a range of areas.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">Thoughtful and motivated counsellors, teachers, and administrators
work with students and their families to ensure that all students have the
opportunity to reach their full potential at MIS.</p>
