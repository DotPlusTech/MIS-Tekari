exploration of self in relation to others. It helps the development of critical
empathy for fellow humans and towards the natural, physical and social worlds.<br />Through theatre/street-plays students are given opportunity to create their own
dramas and attend plays presented by others also bringing about social awareness
through street-plays. Through this medium of learning, students are transported
to worlds past, present, and future --- the ultimate in "virtual reality.”</p>

Children with Special Educational Needs are integrated into all classes and given appropriate help where needed. There is always a discussion with parents before extra support is organised and dialogue continues so that parents are kept informed of their child's progress and of the stage at which the child is working as outlined in the Special Needs Code of Practice. We have an identiﬁed member of staff, who supports the work of children with special. </p>
