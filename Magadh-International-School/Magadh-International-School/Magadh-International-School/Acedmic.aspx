                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">Magadh International School believes that the classroom experiences of children are to be organized in a manner that permits them to construct knowledge in consonance with the child’s nature and context, thus providing equal learning opportunities for all children. Teaching aims at enhancing the child’s innate desire and acumen to learn. Activity is at the heart of children’s attempt to make sense of the world around them. Therefore, every resource is deployed in a child-centric manner to enable them to express themselves, handle objects, explore their natural and social milieu, and to grow up in good health.</p>

Equal attention is given to the development of the body, mind and spirit. Consequently, teachers provide students with the individual attention necessary to help them achieve their goals. Critical judgment is encouraged so that students can discuss topics with coherent arguments supported by evidence. Moreover, teachers know, motivate and understand their pupils and have a deep knowledge of the subject. Records of progress are shared periodically with parents. An extensive academic programme is planned and reviewed periodically ensuring that all classes achieve consistently high results. Classes are interactive and students learn in very stimulating and motivating ways.</p>

Following a Montessori approach, we believe that children are active learners, explorers, experimenters and artists. Therefore the young impressionable minds are provided with a rich, meaningful and balanced curriculum based on the development of the essential skills and `Multiple Intelligence ’. The system stresses on the importance of providing wings to their little angels. Our classrooms have themes including underwater, space, animals etc., and we have both indoor and outdoor activity areas for our tiny tots. Whereas the indoor activity room has a range of exercises and models that help children develop necessary skills, the outdoor area comes fitted with a train-themed playstaion for our little angels. A great amount of focus is given on development of multiple skills in children through language, phonic activities, and stress is laid on development of cognitive skills.</p>

At Magadh International School we believe in enabling children to realize their own potential to excellence and to nurture their young minds through knowledge and exposure. The Primary wing opens its arms to the little learners who walk into our world with expectations and desires. It is our endeavor to facilitate them to develop as social beings by guiding them to interact and cooperate with each other.<br />Our Curriculum incorporates current Educational thinking and the most effective pedagogical practices. It represents a process of revision that is both evolutionary and developmental. We firmly believe in taking children out of the classroom spaces to experience the real world through varied experiments and hand-on activities. Our aim is to foster the child in all dimensions of his or her life— moral, spiritual, cognitive, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social and physical. In order to realize this view of the child and education, our curriculum outlines a detailed and structured framework of content that is comprehensive and flexible.<br />It promotes the active involvement of children in a learning process that is imaginative and stimulating. The ability to think critically, to apply learning and to develop flexibility and creativity are also important factors in the success of the child’s life.
Various activities are designed round the year keeping in view the wholesome development of children in mind. The school focuses on taking learning to another level through the celebration of subjects over weeks such as -Literary, Technomathematik, Eloquence week etc. which gives an impetus to children’s logical and creative thinking. Reading books aloud to children stimulates their imagination and expands their understanding of the world besides developing their language and listening skills.
<br />The extensive Reading Programme from Pre Primary to Grade – III demands the involvement of learners, parents and mentors on a common platform. This not only strengthens the bond between the three, but also enhances the learner’s vocabulary with developed interest for reading. Assemblies are another important feature of our School life. They act as a medium to reflect our positive school ethos and value based education through student’s participation and achievements. Therefore, an important goal of our curriculum is to enable children to learn how to learn and to develop an appreciation of the value and practice of lifelong learning.</p>

                                                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1rem;">“The function of Education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character-that is the goal of true education.”-Martin Luther King, Jr<br />Education in Middle and High Schools these days is rapidly changing. The conventional notion of a classroom where the students would sitting quietly and neatly in their seats, while the teacher would up front pour pearls of wisdom and knowledge into their brains is a practice of past. There has been a paradigm shift in the pedagogies from the old system and is constantly evolving with each passing year.<br />Reality in the 21st century is quite contrary to the old methodology. Our students come into the classroom with the same attitudes and expectations as the society in which they live, from varied backgrounds. The main objective at school, hence, is to take up the responsibility of grooming children holistically, strengthening the scholastic and co-scholastic areas while reinforcing the value system or the ‘Sanskars’ to turn each Magadhian into a Good Samaritan.<br /><br /><b>“A carefully constructed structure of education is supposed to smoothen the pursuit of knowledge, instead of restricting the flow of knowledge.”</b><br />The need of the hour is an educational system that works for and with students. Keeping in mind the present generation’s curiosity and eagerness to learn, it becomes imperative to adopt an approach that would take care of innovative student-centred learning environment enabling an educator to deal effectively with all types of students in the same classroom.
Even an educator’s role is changing from the traditional “imparter of knowledge” to that of coach and consultant. There are many exciting examples of successful strategies and programs in which the students are not only allowed, but encouraged and required, to take responsibility for much more of their learning than ever before.<br />Do-it-yourself, student-to-student teaching, project-based learning, and student-centred learning environments are some of the more encouraging programs. Also, the integration of technology into every subject and at all grade levels allows unprecedented levels and types of exciting collaboration and learner to learner connectivity.<br />Middle school offers maximum flexibility in terms of experiential and experimental learning. On one hand, there is lots to offer to the age bracket of middle school learners and lots of vitality that can be fruitfully manoeuvred, on the other hand, this age group is the most turbulent in terms of the emotional quotient, hence, maintaining a balance.<br />Keeping all the above factors in view, we design working of students in small groups, perform different learning tasks and learn from different books. Teachers provide guidance, and all students have the opportunity to participate in school activities.
MIS provides educational experiences that emphasize the instruction and overall well-being of learners. Working collaboratively, teachers, counsellors, administrators and many parents address middle school student’s learning and socialization needs and ensure some degree of success for all learners. They also recognize and address adolescents’ developmental diversity.
We aim to recognize learner diversity, employ educators trained in middle school education, offer exploratory curricular programs that encourage learner interest, provide age-appropriate guidance and counselling, ensure equal access to educational experiences, promote a positive school environment, and involve parents and families in the educational process.
It is important to state that the middle schools do not downplay academic achievement and appropriate behaviour. Quite the contrary, teachers and administrators emphasize these fundamental aspects of education, but they also provide learning experiences that meet individual needs.<br /><br /><b>“Education means nourishing the mind and make it develop in order to see beyond the limitations of current social perception.”</b></p>

At MIS, we are of the fervent view that learners should be allowed to discover rather than be instructed about already known facts. Endorsing the view propounded by eminent developmental psychologist, Jean Piaget, “when you teach a child something you take away forever his chance of discovering it for himself”, classes at MIS have been designed to ignite the curiosity of young minds, nurture critical and lateral thinking and encourage creativity and innovation. The aim is to equip learners with the skills and competencies required to face the challenges of the 21st century world, thereby preparing them for life.<br />The Educational Programme at MIS, as per the guidelines of the Central Board of Secondary Education, provides a variety of subject choices to the learners. The curriculum is further enriched by the School through an innovative and interdisciplinary approach.<br />The teaching methodology is based on experiential learning to enable learners to acquire a better grasp of diverse concepts. Higher order thinking skills and value based questions form an integral part of the learning process. Department Weeks are organized on a regular basis to foster love for subjects and further the students’ knowledge and understanding of the subjects.<br />Activity based learning is marked across subjects. Languages are nurtured through role plays, debate, interviews, among others. Love and interest in Mathematics is nurtured through mathematical games, use of manipulatives, Vedic Math techniques among others. The Sciences are nurtured through innovation and experimentation.<br />We acknowledge the importance of unconventional and free spirited ways of education, and are of the fervent view that the educational approach should facilitate the process of tuning the permeable boundaries of the curious minds, and making them more sensitive, socially accountable and integrated.</p>

MIS gets the best out of children in every department. The school teachers and mentors work closely with parents to identify and nurture the latent potential of children which ultimately boosts their overall character development. At MIS children can take up computer lab, physical activities, team sports, singing & dancing, art and craft and lots more.
We have associate mentors for each department and we believe that this “other side of a student’s life” must be given a proper sense of empowerment.</p>

The staff members are chosen after a rigorous selection process. As part of our various skill- training programmes, we also impart special training to our teachers on a regular basis to keep them updated about newer trends in the teaching methodology.
